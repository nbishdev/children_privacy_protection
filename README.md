### Description
In this project we attempt to create a facial censorship system which hides the faces of young children in images by replacing them with emojis. To this purpose we employ:
* [**YOLOface**](https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface) for face detection
* [**vit-keras**](https://github.com/faustomorales/vit-keras) for face classification (child / non-child)

### Dataset
The dataset we used was a custom dataset which consisted of images of people. These images were mainly harvested from the web. We also used some pictures of our families and relatives. Because of this, the dataset will NOT be shared in this repository or anywhere else.

## Instructions

### Create the dataset

Create a directory and insert some images containing faces in there. Use the full path of that directory in the `PATH_TO_DATASET` variable inside `src/utils/face_detection_yolo.py`.

```console
cd src/utils
python3 face_detection_yolo.py
```

By default, the extracted faces will be stored in `src/utils/faces_extracted` but this can be changed by modifying the `OUTPUT_PATH` variable.

Finally, manually choose what faces belong to infants and what does not, the first ones should be added to a directory `babies` and the second ones to a directory named `not-babies`.


### Perform predictions

In order to perform predictions with an already trained model, enter the `src/predict` directory. Set the `PATH_TO_DEMO_IMGS` and `PATH_TO_EMOJIS` inside the `perform_predictions.py`. The first directory corresponds to the directory that the images for the demo will be stored and the second one is the directory that contains the available images that will be used to hide the faces of infants. Set also the `PATH_TO_MODEL` variable to point to the `model.h5` file of the trained model.

```console
python3 perform_predictions.py
```
### Directories Description

#### Train
**Contains Jupyter Notebooks for model training**

src/train/

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ./resnet.ipynb - ResNet - 50 Fine tuning model
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ./vggface_custom_model.ipynb - VGGFace - ResNet - 50 Fine tuning model

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ./vggface_feture_extraction.ipynb - VGGFace feture extraction and then classify via Feed Forward Neural Net

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ./visual_transformers.ipynb - Visual Transformers model training

 
 Set the needed parameters inside of the Jupyter Notebooks, set your enviroment and the models will run out of the box.
